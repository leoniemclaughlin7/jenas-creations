# Agile

## Introduction

Agile planning methodology was used to create the site Jenas Creations. GitHub projects was used to organise the development process into sprints, epics, Kanban boards and issues. The benefits of using agile methodology in this project include but are not limited to, having a plan in place, having a dedicated timeframe to achieve issues and overall organisation. I first started by creating Epics. These epics where created using GitHub milestones. Once the epic was created, detailed user stories where added which fit the criteria of the epic. Each user story had a detailed acceptance criteria and unit tasks associated with each issue. These issues where labelled using the MoSCoW technique. This project was completed over Two sprints of development. One sprint contained many epics and within this many issues.

## MoSCoW

MoSCoW analysis helps developers understand which tasks to prioritise. It is a process by which labels are added to issues. These labels include 'Must-have', 'Should-have' and ' Wont-have'. In my project I tried to ensure 'Should-have' prioritised user stories was not more than 60% of total user stories. On reflection, I did not use 'Wont-have' labels and prioritised more 'Must-have' and 'Should-have' labels. In future projects i would consider using more 'Wont-have' labels to detail the work that wont be prioritised during development. The image below shows a portion of the issues associated with this project and their labels in place.
